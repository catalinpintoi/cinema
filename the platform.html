                  "The Platform" (original title: "El Hoyo") is a Spanish
                  science fiction horror film that was released on Netflix in
                  2020. Directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia and starring Ivan
                  Massagué, Zorion Eguileor, and Antonia San Juan, the film
                  takes place in a dystopian future where prisoners are housed
                  in a vertical tower with one cell per level.

               <p>
                  The premise of the film revolves around a platform that
                  descends from the top of the tower to the bottom, carrying
                  food for the prisoners. However, as it descends, the food
                  becomes scarcer, and those at the bottom levels are left with
                  little to eat, while those at the top indulge in excess. The
                  film explores themes of inequality, social class, and the
                  human condition, as the characters struggle to survive and
                  maintain their morality in a brutal and unforgiving systemS.

                  "The Platform" received critical acclaim for its innovative
                  storytelling, thought-provoking themes, and strong
                  performances. It has been praised for its ability to create
                  tension and suspense, as well as its use of gore and violence
                  to comment on contemporary social issues. Overall, it is a
                  must-watch for fans of science fiction, horror, and dystopian
                  narratives.
